# Assessment of flexible highway pavement deflection using Intelligent Pavement Assessment to estimate deflection in adjacent lanes with the use of Machine Learning.
Effective road pavement management plays a crucial role in safety and the economy. The ability to predict deflection in road lanes is essential for identifying areas that require maintenance. To achieve this, dynamic equipment surveys, such as the Intelligent Pavement Assessment (iPAVe), can be employed as a replacement for static methods like the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD), commonly used in Brazil. Therefore, this study aims to compare the deflection prediction capability in road pavements based on adjacent lane surveys using three Machine Learning models: Deep Neural Network (DNN), Random Forest (RF), and Ensemble Prediction (EP). Geospatial data were processed and divided into training (2/3) and test (1/3) sets. The DNN was configured with optimized parameters after several tests, with 400 epochs, while the RF used 500 estimators. The EP model used both DNN and RF as base models with the same hyperparameters. The models underwent cross-validation. The results showed that the EP model outperformed the others in terms of performance. In cross-validation, the EP model obtained an average Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 53.42, average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 5.22, average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 7.30, and an average R-squared (R2) of 0.90. These results indicate that the EP model provided more accurate and consistent predictions of deflections in adjacent lanes, despite limitations and opportunities for improvement. Thus, the study provided a promising foundation for the development of deflection prediction models in road pavements. However, challenges, such as the timing of surveys and the comparison of different methods, were identified. Future research may focus on improving training data, obtaining data from both sides of the lane using iPAVe, and conducting more in-depth studies on the influences of variables on the model. The results of this study may have practical implications for pavement management and highway maintenance.
