# Evaluation of flexible pavement deflection using Intelligent Pavement Assessment
## Estimation of deflection in adjacent lanes using Machine Learning for prioritization of field surveys
This study compared the prediction models, Deep Neural Network (DNN), Random Forest (RF), and Ensemble Prediction (EP) with the aim of estimating deflection in adjacent lanes on road pavements, comparing static and dynamic survey values. The research also proposed a method for prioritizing inspection sites. The results obtained revealed that the EP model demonstrated satisfactory performance in predicting deflection based on the data collected. The performance metrics of the EP model were: MSE of 49.93, MAE of 4.98, RMSE of 7.06, and RÂ² of 0.89. These results indicated that the EP model had a more suitable behavior and less variation compared to the other models. The practical implications of these results are promising in the field of pavement management. The data obtained can be used to fill gaps in field surveys, which is important for efficient and accurate pavement management. In addition, these predictions can be valuable in network planning, assisting in identifying stretches of highways that require priority surveys. However, this study is not without challenges and limitations. The temporality of the iPAVe and FWD surveys proved to be a challenge, as the data were not collected simultaneously. In addition, the abundance of geospatial data required special care in analysis. It is important to mention that this work compared two different survey methods: iPAVe (dynamic) and FWD (static), which may introduce some variability in the results.
